The First Law of Thermodynamics, Applied to Laundry:
$$ \Delta U_{\text{laundry}} = Q_{\text{dryer}} - W_{\text{folding}} $$
where $\Delta U$ is the change in the state of your laundry pile, $Q$ is the heat added by the dryer, and $W$ is the work you don't do.

The Uncertainty Principle of Coffee:
$$ \Delta C \cdot \Delta S \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} $$
where $\Delta C$ is the uncertainty in your caffeine levels, $\Delta S$ is the uncertainty in your sleep schedule, and $\hbar$ is Planck's constant (of waking up).

The Inevitability of Data Loss:
$$ P(\text{crash}) \propto \frac{1}{\text{Backup Frequency}^2} $$
where $P(\text{crash})$ is the probability of your computer crashing, and Backup Frequency is measured in minutes.

The Ideal Gas Law, for a Cat in a Box:
$$ PV = nRT - \text{meow} $$
where $P$ is the pressure of the cat's demands, $V$ is the volume of the box, $n$ is the number of naps, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature of the cat's disapproval, and `meow` is the correction factor for its displeasure.

The Equation for a Simple Pendulum, with a Toddler:
$$ \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L}\sin\theta = -k\frac{d\theta}{dt} + F_{\text{tantrum}}(t) $$
where $\theta$ is the angle of the swing, $L$ is the length of the chain, $g$ is the gravitational constant, $k$ is the friction coefficient of sand, and $F_{\text{tantrum}}(t)$ is the external force applied by a screaming child.
